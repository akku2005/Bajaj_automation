# Madhuri : Card Notes


**Bajaj -**

**Current state -**
Product -

```
● Loans Unsecured: PL, BL, Professional Loan, Loan on Property, Loan Balance Transfer, Loan
against Property Transfer
● CC
● EMI Card
● Health Insurance
● Term Insurance
● Investment - Broking broking by Bajaj, Aditya Birla, SBI
● Mutual Fund
```
**Flow :**

**BRE → DB → Netcore –segment→ segment sequencing → campaign → report**

**funnel.**

```
Traffic netcore Marketing team , business team, web
team , mobile team
ALL TRY FOR LEAD
```
```
LEAD — API
Is only automated solvency
```
```
lead Netcore journey
AIP Calling + blast campaign
Disbursment
(ATS average tiket size, IRR
interest rate)
```
Currently, this is the funnel from traffic to disbursement and in that ats and irr is important factors.
Campaign are running through netcore and cpass (karix & infobib)
They have only three channel paid media → Whatsapp, SMS, RCS.

So they have structure –
All data are present in DB —> then data will split between upper funnel and lower funnel. Which is two
different teams.
Then after that upper funnel -> spit into loans , cc & mutual funds
And then in loans there are three channel and each channel have diff separate campaign manager.
But most of the time it happens 80% data is the same between loans and cc.

Apart from this they have wpn and apn.
Which they are running via 8 different slots with 8 different team.


**(Currently this all funnel is pretty unclear like need more clarification on it)**

**Current customer Journey - (this one will also vary)**

Customer Current Journey :

```
Stage Description Data Source / System
```
**1. Traffic /
Acquisition**

```
Users enter via paid media, UTM links, and
Branch deep links (NTP/ETP campaigns).
```
```
Adobe Analytics
(clickstream, UTM),
Branch
```
**2. Landing &
Verification**

```
Users land on Web/App , enter mobile
numbers, and complete OTP verification.
```
```
Website / App,
Authentication Layer
```
**3. Credit & History
Enrichment**

```
User data is enriched with credit bureau /
financial history for eligibility scoring.
```
```
Credit Bureau APIs,
Internal Databases
```
**4. Business Rule
Engine (BRE)**

```
BRE applies eligibility logic → generates
preliminary offers or no offers
```
```
BRE + Offer Logic
Repository
```
**5. Database
Storage (DB)**

```
All lead, offer, and eligibility data stored in
DB.
```
```
Central DB (Lead, Offer,
Rejection Tables)
```

**6. CRM Integration** Verified and enriched data as user
    properties flows into Netcore for next-stage
    processing and nurturing.

```
CRM (Netcore,
Salesforce, etc.)
```
**7. Segmentation
Layer**

```
Leads are segmented dynamically based
on CIBIL, city, source, and behavioral
attributes. (segment are dynamic but rules
are static)
```
```
Segmentation Engine /
Data Platform
```
**8. Campaign
Execution**

```
Campaigns are executed through Netcore
/ Karix / Infobib via chosen channels
(SMS, RCS, WhatsApp, Push & nudges
(non-paid channels)).
```
```
CPaaS (Karix),
Marketing Automation
Platform
```
**9. Mid-Funnel
Engagement**

```
Users who interacted but didn’t convert are
nurtured through remarketing (AIP
follow-ups, call centre). - not happening
```
```
Campaign DB, Call
Centre, Re-marketing
Journeys
```
**10. Partner
Selection**

```
Qualified leads are pushed to partners for
approval; rejection logic handled
automatically.
```
```
Partner DB, Rejection
History, API Integrations
```
**11. Disbursement** Final approved leads disbursed via partner
    teams.

```
Product / Sales Teams,
Contact Centre
```
**12. Feedback Loop** Rejections, engagement, and conversion
    data feed back into the system for model
    retraining and next prediction cycle.

```
Netcore, CPaaS, BRE,
Internal DB
```
**Core Inputs for segment**

```
● Offer Synopsis (S1 to S4) (S1 is probably who have great cibil score, good history)
● CIBIL score
● City
```
**JY**

```
● Single sign-on
● Calling – end-to-end funnel control
```
**Monthly Metrics**


**30 K installs**

```
● MAU – 24L
● DAU – 18L
```
**Challenges :**

```
● Lack of governance across - a) channel b) business/product c) funnel (mobile app vs business) d)
platform (CPaas and Netcore)
● System Intelligence is past learning, it is not optimized using attributes or traits.
● System lacks understanding of partner, channel and product affinity.
● There is opportunity to optimize the “No-Offer Base”.
● Reject model and reject retargeting can be built.
● Lead and AIP for ETP is high and NTP is low.
```
**Core levers and campaigns**

1. Product affinity (offer) 2. Channel affinity 3. Partner affinity 4. Segmentation 5. Eligibility 6. Creative

7.Governance 8. Credit score

KPIs

```
● ATS (increase in disbursement and AIP)
```
```
● IRR (frequency capping)
```
## ● COA

```
○ AIP, Lead
```
```
○ CTR, Engagement metrics - reduce uninstall
```
uninstall


Fragmented across

1. Channel 2. Product 3. Partner

Segmentation and campaigns are

Manual + Static rules

duplicated messaging → user fatigue → Higher COA

# Vishal notes


**Bajaj 2nd meeting with Vaibhav**
Need to optimise COA
Core levers for campaign
Offer- product affinity
Partner affinity
Eligibility
**Segmentation**
Creative
Channel affinity - responsiveness
**Governance**

Need to build intelligence and governance which can solve for product affinity (offer affinity, ), channel
affinity and partner affinity
Need to build governance across C-pass (Inofbip, Karix) and Netcore
Need to build governance across funnel

Marketing team run campaigns for top funnel and mid funnel (AIP creation)
Individual product teams like CreditCard , loans, Insurance would run call center and blast campaigns
lower funnel

S1 s2 s3 and s4 are
Need to build an intelligence layer where input is the total offer base , total budget and total target
It should output segment and campaign as next best action
It should have a governance layer

There are more than **130+ attributes** in net core
We need **categorise the attributes as product affinity, channel affinity , responsiveness**
We need to the optimise these attributes into segments for offer and governance
**Meta —> app —. Mob —> lead —.AIP —Partner — Disbursement
CRM —. Web journeys. —> lead —.AIP —Partner — Disbursement
BRE —> DB —. `’—> lead to AIP**

**Segment. —> campaign creation and execution**

Can I **build predictive segmentation -**
This **should improve CTR and governance**
This should improve
**optimize over AIP
Optimise cost of loan disbursement - COA**


**Day 2 Bajaj Notes
Traffic —> lead —. AIP —> Disbursement**
Partner affinity
Reject data / model - / partner reject data

1. If a customer is rejected for a particular partner he cannot be eligible for same partner
2. If a customer is rejected for a particular product he might still get an offer from BRE on another
    product
3. If a customer gets rejected from whole journey then we have a reject stamp while he might be
    eligible for another partner product
● Acquisition campaign
● If customer has gone to partner pages - we get this data from adobe events
● User properties
● Offers
● Reject data - previous application data
● Bureau data

Partner affinity is hard to build.. while product affinity
We have more focus on top 5 partners where there is high revenue margin
Following are attributes for product affinity UTM data and branch data

```
● Acquisition campaign - media
● Click stream on the platform - adobe
● User properties - netcore / DB
● Bureau data - last 30- 90 days which enquires the customer has done
```
Current process
**Media —> web / App —> MOB —ICORS (API of BFL)**
— Credit score journey —> RT ch Offer
— Lead. —> AIP (this is where BRE
gets triggered and he will get listing offers )
—> ICORS
—> RT CH
Offer
—> Listing offer
(Dar Offers)

There is opportunity to build a predictive capability on top of database which has been updated with BRE
We can look at the user data from cibil , his campaign data , his product affinity, his rejection in last on
particular partners and build an offer for a particular partner which is top 5 partners
The Cibili data has details about has the user made enquiry for a particular. Product like a loan from some
other platform

There are around 30k install to launch new customer every day and around 60% of these will login
There is a DAU of 1.8 L base and MAU of 24 L base (11l ne new - first install - repeat install, 13 l is
coming from previous month )

Products I have


Loans

- PL, GL, HL , Loan on property , balance transfer , loan against property transfer

```
● BL
● Professional loan to doctors and CA
● CC
● Emi Card
● Health insurance
● Term insurance
● Investment - mutual fund, broking by Bajaj , Aditya Birla , SBI
```
Inputs to the system —.

1. Goals and targets
2. Budgets
3. Offers from DB
4. User properties from net core
5. Event properties from campaign in net core - responsiveness
6. Adobe user behavioural data from platform
7. C360 - this is one time past data
8. Match logic (partner affinity and product affinity)
9. Media campaign data - UTm and branch data (product affinity) and creative affinity
10. CPass data for responsiveness
11. Disposition data from calling (Markets will start calling from lead)
Out puts
1. Prediction
look for conversion drivers from AIP of past users
2. Segmentation
    1. Used for WA, SMS, RCS
    2. Personalisation using Plot line -
    3. Nudge campaigns on net core
    4. Push - in app and. web

Budgets
10 % to create leads from traffic
**90% to create AIP from Leads**
A user in his journey post AIP get listing offers and might select first offer and might rejected
The system stamps as rejected while he may be eligible for other partners

1. I use input as budget and target daily , weekly , monthly
2. I use input offer base
3. I use event and user properties has input
4. I connect the DB and BRE
5. The system will guide for segments to create AIP
6. The system will keep check on governance across channels and LOB at top funnel


7. The system will help guide Low funnel teams to run bias campaigns and maintain governance
    across lob
8. The system will create segment for right offer to the customer by channel product and partner
9. I can have budget & target at bajaj market and each product
10. The system gives me segment which are unique or over allying but optimised per user

**Day 3 bajaj**
App engagement needs to increase - uninstall becomes very critical number
JVs - top 5 partners
Our team is doing billing
Controlling sales funnel
More revenue
More margins
JV -

1. Where we do calling - end to end control - more visibility -m approval from client (federal, KB ,
Payu , Kisht )
2. Single sign on (Fibe)
There is man approach that first 7 days there are same segments, next 10 days similar segments
More rejections because of credit score

```
● What are education campaigns for credit score to improve credit score
● PFM - too far fetched
● Ondc - too far fetched
```
3 end to end journey integrations

Early salary brand name - Fibe

80% new installs, 20% reinstalls - out of 11 lakh users
About 13 lakhs is from previous month

**Traditionally manually first 7 days one segment campaigns are run on, then next 10 days
another segment and so on**

**Engagement products - 3**

**1. Credit score - education campaigns for this
2. Personal Expense Manager PFM can flag - ask people to track expenses, ask to**
    **link people’s banks - this is the hook for engagement, daily refresh based on**
    **account
3. ONDC**

App engagement from 50 to 75% - app un-installment is critical number


Engagement hook - track credit score from this app only instead of uninstalling and finding
someone else - Bajaj bears the cost of this for those who want to generate score on their app -
45 day refresh - how to raise score is also shown

Calling response rate should also be considered - just like whatsapp sms data, and if leads are
getting generated

Meta - app journey
Channel campaigns - web journeys (channel like SMS RCS)
Most of the campaigns are on Web journey

Apart from this there is organic traffic which isn’t considered n the campaign level yet

Netcore - executive part, everything else ai decisioning, ai agent

DNC- do not call, communication preference all becomes the input to the intelligence agent

Personalization guardrails - remove all offensive words so they cannot be used as first names
etc.

There is an inhouse POC done on python and SQL which has shown value

Media spend is always to get traffic - meta ads, google ads
CRM across teams is netcore - karix is only support - but all data is all on netcore

After aip before disbursement there are broadcastcampigns that run

Only new customer base is being stored - takes data and rejects offer?

Push to partner P2P - is it successful
Post that we don’t know if they have dropped or not
So, COA counted on disbursement

I2A install to lead A2D aip to disbursement
Cost per kead cost per aip cost per disbursement traffic to lead

RTCHR made 2 types -
first flow is on an active lead, a crosssell offer between the loans product offer is made, s
econd flow is CHR credit report all offers made

There is opportunity for people who have not logged in after app download, but this reach is less

9 cr data
Mcf mobile campaign on flag
Rcf
Wcf
95% data on etp and rest on ntp - very less

# Final


**Summary**

CRM execution today is fragmented across products, channels, and partners. Segmentation is
manual and static, leading to duplicated messaging, rising fatigue, and higher COA. As scale
increases, responsiveness, eligibility, and partner approval patterns change faster than rules can
be updated.

Introducing an intelligence layer enables decisions on **who to target, with which offer, and on
which channel** , based on live data and governed budgets.

Outcomes:

```
● Higher AIP (approved in principal) conversion
● Lower COA through budget optimization
● Media efficiency via Unified governance across Netcore + CPaaS and across funnel
stages
● Higher app engagement, lower uninstall rate
```
**CRM at Scale**

```
● ~100M+ customers, multiple offers per customer across PL, CC, Insurance.
● Analytics owns BRE + DB (offer mapping, eligibility, partner logic).
● Marketing uses Netcore + CPaaS (Karix, Infobip) for top/mid funnel.
● Product teams + call center teams handle lower funnel.
```
**Customer Journey**

```
● Traffic → Lead → AIP → Disbursement
● Media → Web/App → MOB → ICORS → Credit Score → Lead → AIP (BRE triggers offers) →
Partner Selection → Disbursement
```

**AI Decisioning & Governance Engine**

A single decision layer that selects **offer + channel + timing** while enforcing governance.

It:

```
● Reads user & offer data from Warehouse + BRE + Netcore
● Scores product, partner, and channel affinity per user
● Allocates budget by target and revenue priority
● Outputs next-best segment + campaign action
● Enforces fatigue, eligibility, and partner rules
```
**Core Levers (Campaign optimisation)**

```
● Product Affinity (offer-fit per user)
● Partner Affinity (approval & margin likelihood)
● Eligibility (BRE + reject history + bureau)
● Segmentation (adaptive, per-user)
● Creative Variation
● Channel Affinity (responsiveness)
● Governance (cross-channel + cross-funnel)
```
**Expected Business Impact**

```
● App engagement ↑ and uninstall ↓ - byproducts
● Revenue : Higher Lead → AIP → Disbursement
● Efficiency : Lower COA
● Engagement: Higher CTR
● Governance: Unified fatigue & frequency management
● Speed: Near real-time segment refresh
● Transparency: Explainable decision rationale
● Every interaction improves the next (learning loop)
```

**Bajaj Markets: From Rule-Based CRM to**

**Agentic AI Decisioning**


**1. The Shift We Need**

Bajaj Markets manages a digital marketplace spanning loans, credit cards, insurance, and
investments—reaching **100 million+ customers**.
Each day, millions of offers flow from internal systems to marketing channels. Yet campaign
decisions remain _rule-driven_ , _manual_ , and _siloed_.

To scale profitably and cut the **Cost of Acquisition (COA)** , Bajaj Markets must evolve from
_static CRM execution_ to _goal-driven, self-learning intelligence_ —an **Agentic AI Decisioning
Engine** that learns from every interaction, optimises in real time, and enforces governance
automatically.

**The Context: Bajaj Markets CRM at Scale**

```
● 100M+ customers with multiple offers each (one per product type).
● ₹2 Cr/month CRM spend across SMS, WhatsApp, and RCS.
● Independent marketing teams per product (Personal Loan, Credit Card, Insurance).
● Analytics team governs Business Rules Engine (BRE) and Database (offer mapping,
eligibility, partner logic).
● Marketing (Top and Mid funnel ) & Business (Lower Funnel) runs Netcore + CPaaS
(Infobip, Karix) for execution, managing top- and mid-funnel campaigns (lead → AIP →
Disbursement).
● Individual business teams handle lower funnel (call-center, remarketing).
```
The result: massive reach — but **fragmented intelligence**. Every channel and business line
optimizes locally, not globally.

```
```
Governance Manual Netcore flags Frequency capping &

```
100 + user / event attributes exist in Netcore, but remain **under-categorised** and **under-used**.

**3. The Problem**

```
● Manual segmentation → high overlap, inconsistent governance
```
```
● Static rules → missed opportunities & over-blocking
```
```
● Siloed teams → no unified spend-to-target optimisation
○ Provide intelligence to lower funnel about segments , offer , creative , messaging
○
● Reactive measurement → responsiveness based only on past clicks
```
```
● Rising COA and plateaued AIP conversion
```
**4. Strategic Shift: Outcome-Driven Decisioning**

Inspired by modern AI-decisioning platforms such as Aampe and Hightouch, Bajaj Markets will
move to a **goal-first model** :

```
“Define the business goal → Let intelligence optimise the path.”
```
**Primary Goals**

1. **Increase AIP Conversion** (top-funnel KPI → revenue)
2. **Boost CTR & Engagement** (improve lead quality)
3. **Optimise COA and CRM Spend**
4. **Enforce Cross-Channel Governance** (fatigue & budget guardrails)
**5. Introducing the AI Decisioning & Governance Engine**


**Core Promise**

A single _agentic intelligence layer_ that uses **reinforcement learning** to balance offer, channel,
partner, and timing decisions—while staying within predefined **guardrails** for budget, frequency,
and compliance.

**It Does**

```
● Reads all user & offer data from BRE (DB) + Netcore
```
```
● Understands declared objectives (e.g., ↑ Traffic to Lead by 10%, AIP ↑ by 10% )
```
```
● Generates micro-experiments per customer to test combinations
○ We can use plot line for experimentation
```
```
● Allocates communications across SMS / RCS / WhatsApp optimally
```
```
● Learns from each interaction (CTR → Lead → AIP → Disbursement)
```
```
● Adheres to guardrails (budget caps, frequency, partner rules)
```
```
● Outputs next-best segment & campaign actions
```
**6. Core Levers Re-imagined**

```
Lever Current State Agentic Transformation
```
```
Offer / Product Affinity Static mapping from

```

optimise multiple offers of a

**8. Attribute Intelligence Framework**

```
Category Examples Output
```
```
Product Affinity Offer type, amount, tenure, CIBIL band Offer Propensity Score
```
```

```
```
Channel Affinity Responsiveness, deliverability, recency Optimal Channel
Score
```
```
Engagement
Signals
(responsiveness)
```
```
CTR, session depth, recency Responsiveness Index
```
(We need to add partner reject model data back to intelligence layer. There would be top 5
partners where we have better margins and where customer has not been rejected. In this case
if we focus on campaigns / offers / products for those partners there is better conversions and
better revenue)

These features fuel a **reward-based AI loop** that learns which combinations maximise AIP
while staying within spend and fatigue limits.


**9. Governance & Guardrails**

**Multi-Dimensional Governance**

```
● Cross-Platform: Netcore + CPaaS (Infobip, Karix)
● Cross-LOB: PL, CC, Insurance
● Cross-Funnel: Marketing → AIP → Call Centre
```
**Guardrails Enforced**

```
● Communication frequency caps
```
```
● Channel overlap limits
```
```
● Partner quota and eligibility rules
```
```
● Daily/weekly budget boundaries
```
```
● Compliance & privacy constraints
```
Governance shifts from **manual suppression** to **autonomous policy enforcement**.

**10. Metrics & Learning Loop**

```
KPI Baseline Target Post-AI
```
```

```
```

```
```

```
```
Speed Near-real-time segment creation
```
```
Transparency Explainable AI decisions with guardrails
```
**13. Why It Matters**

This transformation mirrors global best practice (Aampe, Hightouch):

```
● Agentic Infrastructure → Per-user learning agents
```
```
● Goal-First Optimization → Define AIP targets and let AI explore/exploit
```
```
● Continuous Experimentation → Always-on testing vs one-off A/B
```

```
● Governed Autonomy → Intelligence with built-in guardrails
```
Bajaj Markets will own an adaptive infrastructure that keeps learning, rather than a set of static
CRM rules.

**14. Vision Statement**

```
From manual campaigns to autonomous orchestration.
From segments to self-learning agents.
From rules to results.
```
Bajaj Markets’ AI Decisioning Engine will act as its **Agentic Infrastructure for Customer
Engagement** —optimising every message, every channel, every moment for maximum impact.

What do we want to do by 1st quarter


What is the blue sky goal - demand generation

Ai decisioning + ai automation + crm for every prospective customer

We should be able to show that we are stitching data – decisioning – planning – perusal – they
have a calling bot

In the proposal we need -

- Why this route
- Why this is a realistic
- Why not netcore or SaaS
- Why is the a long term journey
- What will i miss- opportunity cost
- Value quarterly


**he want 10-15 slides of deck.**

1. first slide - landscape - what is world doing here.
2. Netcore Multiagent - what is netcore doing vs what is we are suppose to do (difference and
impact- which problem solve)

(Note - add product prototype in what/ how section)

then

step 1 : what section - (Today & Tommorrow) - what we are creating/ building

step 2 : why section - why we are doing - ROI Calculation

step 3 : How Section - (Future & Phases)

Engine - Input & output

after this

Personas + user Journey

usecase -

1. ETP Example :

(Define conditions + Define User persona (5lakh and above offer, current state we sent 4 sms, 3
wp & 2 rcs but responded only on wp, then next 10 days blast --> then we use intelligence ki
next time only wp campaign will share)

(campaign steps + Current state - inshort journey DAY 1 TO DAY 10)

[Goal - offer/persona -> Campaign/ recurring campaign(10 days) -> outcome] --> then will think
about future state

Current state - goverance, segmentation, channel affinity, decisioning --> what is today?

2. NTP Example :

**Summary**

Today, CRM execution is fragmented across products, channels, and partners. Each team
optimizes locally for its own conversion goals, leading to inconsistent targeting, duplicated
messaging, rising fatigue, and higher COA. As scale grows, static rules and manual
segmentation cannot adapt to changing responsiveness, partner approvals, or offer eligibility in
real time.

There is an opportunity to introduce an intelligence layer that learns from user behavior, offer
performance, partner acceptance rates, and channel responsiveness — and uses this to decide
_who to talk to, about what, and through which channel_.

This will:

```
● Improve AIP conversion (main revenue driver)
● Reduce COA by allocating budget with intent
● Increase app engagement and reduce uninstall rate
● Ensure unified governance across Netcore + CPaaS and across funnel stages
```
This approach does not change team workflows. Marketing continues to launch campaigns;
product teams continue lower funnel calling. The difference is the **system guides
segmentation and campaign prioritization** , ensuring each user receives the right offer, on the
right channel, at the right time — within fatigue and budget guardrails.

**CRM at Scale**

**Context**

```
● 100M+ customers, multiple product-level offers.
● ~₹2 Cr/month CRM spend across SMS, WhatsApp, RCS.
● Independent marketing teams by product: PL, CC, Insurance.
● Analytics owns BRE & DB (offer mapping, eligibility, partner logic).
● Marketing & Business use Netcore + CPaaS (Karix, Infobip) for top/mid funnel.

**Agentic AI Decisioning**

**Confidential | Strategic Transformation Blueprint**
_Prepared for: Bajaj Markets Leadership Team
Date: [Insert]_

**Program Objective**

To transform Bajaj Markets’ CRM from manual, rule-based campaign execution into a
**self-learning, AI-powered decisioning engine** that automates offer, partner, and channel
optimization across the full funnel—delivering **higher efficiency, stronger governance, and
improved ROI**.

**Summary**

Bajaj Markets operates a vast digital marketplace across **Loans, Credit Cards, Insurance, and
Investments** , serving **100M+ customers**.
Today, campaign execution is **fragmented** , **manual** , and **siloed** across teams and channels.

● Automate segmentation and campaign creation
```
```
● Enforce governance across Netcore , Infobip , and Karix
```
```
● Optimize the Cost of Acquisition (COA) and improve conversion
```
**Business Goals**


**Immediate (0–6 months)**

```
● ↑ CTR – improve responsiveness across channels
```
```
● ↑ AIP Conversion – boost mid-funnel performance
```
```

# AI Decisioning chatgpt


**AI Decisioning?**

AI decisioning is an automated system that uses LLM, Multi agent architecture , machine
learning, customer data, and business rules to determine **the best offer and next best action
for each customer at any moment**.

Instead of marketers manually selecting segments, channels, or messages, AI decisioning
evaluates all available data in real time and selects the **optimal next step** —such as:

```
● What offer and what product and what partner
● which channel to use (email, WhatsApp, push, SMS, in-app),
● which message to send,
● whether to send a communication at all,
● the best timing, offer, or content variant,
● or whether to wait for more behavioural signals.
```
AI decisioning is the layer that **sits between the DB and the engagement platform** ,
orchestrating personalized offers / actions based on predicted outcomes with clear goals and
budget constraints.

**Key Benefits of AI Decisioning**

**1. Deep Personalisation at Scale**

It evaluates every user independently, creating “segments of one.” in indeal scenario. We can
always create segments which have propensity of AIP
This eliminates broad journeys and ensures that each user / cohort receives what is most
relevant to them.

**2. Higher Conversion and Engagement Rates**

By selecting the most effective product , partner , channel, message, and moment, it boosts
campaign performance across retention, acquisition, reactivation, and upsell cycles.

**3. Reduction of Manual Effort**

Marketers no longer need to create dozens of if/else conditions or complex journeys.
It automates decisions that previously required heavy manual segmentation.


We can work on top of BRE and DB with core user attributes to decide offer base

**4. Real-Time Responsiveness**

AI decisioning works on live behavioural signals and updates decisions instantly as new events
come in. We can feed the netcore and Adobe analytics data in real time before next campaign

**5. More Consistent Customer Experience**

Instead of disconnected decisions across channels / business / funnel , AI ensures the
interaction feels coherent and intelligently sequenced.

**6. Optimised Marketing Spend**

By suppressing low-intent users and prioritising high-propensity ones, it reduces unnecessary
sends and improves ROI.

**7. Transparency and Governance (Modern Systems)**

The platform provides explainability—marketers can see **why** a decision was made, increasing
trust and control.


Key Functionalities of AI Decisioning

**1. Predictive Modelling & Scoring**

Core capabilities include:

```
● propensity to convert
● churn likelihood
● likelihood of AIP of a specific product
● next-best-offer prediction
● LTV prediction
● content/variant recommendation
```
These models become inputs for orchestration decisions.

**2. Real-Time Event Evaluation**

AI decisioning continuously evaluates signals like:

```
● browsing actions (Adobe analytics)
● app events (Netcore and Adobe)
● transaction sequences
● abandonment patterns
● inactivity windows
```
It can reacts instantly to behavioural triggers.

**3. Next-Best-Action (NBA) Decision Engine**

The central layer that decides:

```
● what to send (creative, offer, content)
● when to send (optimal send-time)
● where to send (channel selection)
● whether to send (suppression logic)
```
This is the heart of AI decisioning.


**4. Multi-Channel Orchestration**

Platform coordinates customer actions across:

```
● SMS, Whats app and RCS
● Push , in-app, Nudges , web app
● Web and in App personalisation
● Calling platforms
● Top and bottom funnels
● ad platforms (Meta, Google)
●
```
The AI ensures that channels are used **sequentially and intelligently** , not in silos.

**5. Guardrails & Policy Controls**

To maintain brand and regulatory compliance, most AI decisioning systems include:

```
● frequency caps
● channel-level limits
● override rules
● mandatory suppression conditions
● business constraints (budget, availability, stock)
```
These ensure platform stays within safe operational boundaries.

**6. Unified Customer Data Layer (CDP Integration)**

The platform requires a central identity graph and profile store.
It consumes:

```
● events
● attributes
● transaction history
● product/catalog data
● offline and CRM inputs
```
This allows the decision engine to see the _holistic_ customer context.


**7. Experimentation & Continuous Learning**

Modern systems use:

```
● A/B/n testing
● multi-armed bandits
● reinforcement learning
```
This ensures that the system improves continuously from campaign outcomes.

**8. Governance & Explainability**

Key for enterprise adoption:

```
● decision audit logs
● score rationales
● model performance dashboards
● AI explainability layers
● permission & role controls
```
Marketers can understand and trust the AI outputs.

**Challenges**

Bajaj’s CRM and funnel operations span multiple products, channels, partners, and teams,
supported by systems such as BRE, internal databases, Netcore, CPaaS platforms (Karix,
Infobip), Adobe Analytics, and partner integrations. While all essential data—lead, offer,
eligibility, behavioural, and partner-level information—is available, CRM execution is fragmented
and lacks unified intelligence.

Governance gaps exist across **channels** , **business/product lines** , **funnels (app vs business
journeys)** , and **execution platforms (Netcore vs CPaaS)**. Upper, mid, and lower funnel teams
operate in isolation, and campaigns run independently across SMS, WhatsApp, RCS, Push, and
in-app nudges without a central decisioning layer. This results in inconsistent communication,
frequency breaches, and higher operational inefficiency.

Segmentation and campaign logic are predominantly **manual and static** , driven by fixed rules
rather than dynamic behavioural or attribute-based signals. This leads to duplicated messaging,
increased user fatigue, and elevated COA. Despite having a rich attribute framework—including
CIBIL scores, offer synopsis, city, Adobe behavioural events, and 130+ Netcore properties—the
system continues to rely on past learning instead of real-time traits, customer responsiveness,
or eligibility patterns.

The current system also lacks intelligence around **partner affinity** , **product affinity** , and
**channel responsiveness** , and does not identify or optimize the “no-offer base.” Reject models
and reject retargeting strategies remain unexplored. Funnel movement is inconsistent, with **high
Lead → AIP conversion in ETP** but **lower conversion in NTP** , indicating gaps in eligibility,
targeting precision, and channel choices.

This fragmentation across **channels** , **products** , and **partners** directly impacts the key funnel
stages—Lead → AIP → Disbursement—causing inefficiencies, slower funnel progression, and
missed revenue opportunities. A unified intelligence and governance layer is required to
streamline decisioning, bring consistency, and unlock full value from available customer data.


**Current State Summary – “What Bajaj Looks Like Today”**

**1. Fragmented Execution**

```
● Different teams manage upper, mid, and lower funnel journeys independently.
```
```
● Channels (SMS, WA, RCS, Push) run without unified governance, often leading to
parallel or conflicting communication.
```
```
● CPaaS and Netcore operate as separate execution layers with no centralised oversight.
```
**2. Manual and Static Segmentation**

```
● Segments are manually defined with rigid rules.
```
```
● Limited use of behavioural signals or platform attributes.
```
```
● Results in duplicated communication, fatigue, and inflated COA.
```
**3. Limited System Intelligence**

```
● Decisioning relies on historical performance, not real-time traits.
```
```
● No understanding of product, channel, or partner affinity.
```
```
● No predictive segmentation or next-best-action logic.
```
**4. Gaps in Funnel Optimisation**

```
● Strong Lead → AIP conversion for ETP but weaker for NTP.
```
```
● “No-offer base” remains under-optimized.
```
```
● Reject and re-engagement models are not in place.
```
**5. Underutilised Data Assets**


```
● Rich attributes exist (CIBIL, deliverability scores, reachability, offer synopsis, Adobe
events, Netcore properties).
```
```
● However, they are not systematically leveraged for decisioning.
```
**6. Overall Impact**

```
● Higher user fatigue
```
```
● Higher cost of acquisition
```
```
● Inconsistent partner approval rates
```
```
● Lower disbursement outcomes
```
```
● Missed revenue potential
```
**Re-crafted, Crisp, and Story-Driven Context**

Bajaj’s CRM ecosystem spans multiple products, partners, channels, and platforms (BRE, DB,
Netcore, Karix, Infobip, Adobe). All required data exists—lead, offer, eligibility, behavioural—but
execution is fragmented. Funnel teams (upper, mid, lower) operate independently, and channels
are run in silos without unified governance across business lines, platforms, or journeys.

Segmentation is manual and static, driven by fixed rules instead of behaviour or attributes. This
creates duplicated messaging, customer fatigue, and higher COA. Although Bajaj has rich
attributes—CIBIL, offer synopsis, city, Adobe events, and 130+ Netcore properties—the system
relies on past learning and does not use them for affinity, responsiveness, or eligibility
intelligence.

Key gaps persist: no understanding of partner/product/channel affinity, no optimisation of the
no-offer base, no reject or retargeting models, and inconsistent funnel performance (ETP
stronger; NTP weaker). Overall, CRM operations remain fragmented across channels, products,
and partners, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities across the Lead → AIP →
Disbursement funnel.

A unified intelligence and governance layer is required to streamline communication, reduce
cost, improve AIP conversions, and maximise disbursement outcomes.

**Current State – “What Bajaj Looks Like Today” (Crisp)**


● **Fragmented execution:** Channels, products, partners, and funnels operate
independently.

● **No unified governance:** Netcore vs CPaaS, app vs business journeys, product vs
partner flows.

● **Static segmentation:** Manual rules → duplicated messaging, fatigue, higher COA.

● **Low system intelligence:** Relies on past results; doesn’t use attributes or behavioural
traits.

● **Affinity blind spots:** No view of product, channel, or partner affinity.

● **Missed opportunities:** No-offer base unoptimised; no reject/retargeting models.

● **Funnel inconsistency:** Strong ETP Lead → AIP; weaker NTP movement.

● **Outcome:** Inefficiencies, higher spend, lower conversion, and missed revenue.


## SLIDE CONTENT

Bajaj’s CRM and funnel operations span multiple products, channels, and teams, supported by
systems such as BRE, Databases, Netcore, CPaaS platforms (Karix, Infobip), Adobe Analytics,
and partner integrations. Although all key data—lead, offer, eligibility, and behavioural—is
available, execution across the funnel is fragmented. Upper, mid, and lower funnel teams
operate in silos, and channel execution is split across SMS, WhatsApp, RCS, Push, and nudges
without unified governance.

Segmentation remains manual and static, driven by fixed rules instead of dynamic behaviour or
user attributes. This causes duplicated communication, higher user fatigue, and increased COA.
The organisation has a strong attribute foundation (CIBIL, offer synopsis, city, Adobe events,
130+ Netcore properties), but lacks the intelligence to use it for predictive segmentation, product
affinity modelling, channel responsiveness, or partner-level eligibility.

This fragmentation affects key funnel stages—Lead → AIP → Disbursement—leading to
inefficiencies, inconsistent campaign performance, and missed opportunities to improve AIP
conversion, partner approvals, and revenue. A unified intelligence and governance framework is
required to bring consistency, scale, and data-driven decisioning across the entire CRM
ecosystem.

## OR

Bajaj’s CRM ecosystem runs across multiple products, partners, channels, and
platforms—Netcore, Karix, Infobip, BRE, internal DBs, Adobe Analytics, and partner systems.
Although all key data exists (lead, offer, eligibility, behavioural, CIBIL, 130+ attributes), execution
remains fragmented. Funnel teams (upper, mid, lower) work independently, and communication
is split across SMS, WhatsApp, RCS, Push, and nudges without unified governance across
channels, products, funnels (app vs business), or platforms (Netcore vs CPaaS).

Segmentation today is manual and static, driven by rigid rules and not by real-time behaviour or
traits. This results in duplicated messages, fatigue, and a higher COA. System intelligence relies
only on past learning and does not use attributes to infer partner affinity, channel
responsiveness, or product fit. Key gaps persist—no optimisation of the “no-offer base,” no
reject or retargeting models, and inconsistent funnel performance (high Lead → AIP for ETP;
low for NTP).

Fragmentation across channel, product, and partner causes inefficiencies throughout the Lead
→ AIP → Disbursement funnel, leading to inconsistent performance and missed revenue
outcomes. A unified intelligence and governance layer is needed to bring coherence, reduce
cost, and improve conversion and COA.
